## Package Description

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, many new epidemiological models were developed to predict the number of cases and deaths a country or state might experience in the near future. One such model is the COFFEE (Covid-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimations) model developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Castro, 2020). Unlike traditional disease models, COFFEE incorporates statistical methods to dynamically parameterize a SIR model over time and across populations. This approach reduces the amount of assumptions that must be made about the virus’s spread. Additionally, this method allows for independent forecasts on various scales– state-by-state, country-by-country, or even city-by-city– while remaining sensitive to changes in virus conditions such as transmission rates, social interaction rates, testing kit availability, and many other factors, all without having to model them directly. This allows for long-term predictions, upwards of 30 days or even two months of predictions. Although originally designed for COVID-19, the COFFEE method is adaptable to any pandemic data. This package implements functions that will generate 30-day forecasts of daily cases when given training data for any viral disease. A vignette is available to demonstrate the functionality of my package using COVID-19 data.


## Installation Instructions

Run the command below within your R console:  


`devtools::install_github("dmaywald/coffeeR", build_vignettes = TRUE)`


## Work in Progress

A vignette needs to be made that demonstrates the functionality of this package with COVID-19 data. Outlier detection methods need to be added. Empirical growth rate functions need to be added with sampling function. Forecasting functions need to be implemented.
