Description: The COFFEE (Covid-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimations) model
    developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Castro, 2020) incorporates statistical 
    methods to dynamically parameterize a SIR model over time and across populations. Although 
    originally designed for COVID-19, the COFFEE method is adaptable to any pandemic data. 
    This package implements functions that will generate 14-day forecasts of
    daily cases when given training data for any viral disease. A vignette
    is available to demonstrate the functionality of my package using
    COVID-19 data.
